 * While an account's keys are held in this tab's memory only, a zone made here whose key no other device has would be lost with the
 * tab: its data would stay on the server, unreadable. Closing the tab is asked about first. A zone is safe only when an envelope with
 * its key was really put for another device (`keysReached`), not merely marked as sent. The answer is worked out when the sync
 * state is saved, never on a timer.
