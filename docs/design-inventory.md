# Design inventory: Planner against the designs

- **Designs commit:** `718fa7bea400b0d70594d9e61259d89f8d4ef55a` (orbyn-designs `origin/main`, committed 2026-11-07), files `artifacts/planner-designs.html`, `account-designs.html`, `motion-designs.html`.
- **Page versions:** the brief says Planner Designs v36 and Account Designs v53. The HTML files carry no version marker (the version lives on the artifact server), so these are taken from the brief and not verified here.
- **Planner main checked:** `50b5bc2a3eceba9dbe429ad9ec90cc8d41a8a1b3`. Date: 2026-11-08.
- **Method:** `npx vite --port 5340` on `web/`, headless Chromium (Playwright), device-only mode on sample data from the designs, clock fixed to Sat 7 Nov 2026 08:30 UTC, reduced motion on. Each checked frame was rendered at the design frame size in Light, Dark and Dim next to the design frame (window title bar hidden) and read in all three themes. Copy was also diffed as text.
- **Screenshots** are not committed. Files live in the author’s scratch folder as `design-<id>-<theme>.png`, `build-<id>-<theme>.png` and a three-theme side-by-side `cmp-<id>.png`.
- **Status words.** *matched*: layout, copy, sizes and colours agree in all three themes and I looked at it. *partial*: built, with the listed differences. *not built*: no code for it (the cell says how that was established). *gated*: the frame’s own note says it is not shown today or is Planned. *in progress*: Settings frames being built on the unmerged `feat/settings-copy`; not screenshotted. *not checked yet*: not compared; the component is only a pointer from reading the code.
- **Left out of every “differs” cell** because they hold for all frames and need things this device-only run cannot provide: (G1) the design sidebar has a Booking item and a Notifications count, the build has neither (nav.ts:11; booking and sharing are not built); (G2) the sync pill reads “Synced · 3 devices” in the design and “Connected” in the build, since real sync needs an account and engine; (G3) “Good morning, Sam” needs an account name, the build says “Good morning”; (G4) the design draws a window title bar, the web build has none.

Deep pass (Today, calendar, tasks) is complete. Everything else is marked *not checked yet* unless the code shows the feature is absent or the frame note says it is gated. Frames outside this repository (account site, email, witness, key service, launcher) are listed with the owner and not compared.

### Today

| Frame | Component (web/src) | Status | Shots | Differs / note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Not checked

- Every frame marked *not checked yet*: no render or text comparison was made. Pointers in the component column come from reading the code and a copy match count, not from looking at the screen.
- Sample data was written to approximate the design frames, not copied from them, so counts and a few dates differ for that reason. Differences listed above are the ones that come from the build, not the sample data; where the design’s own sample data disagrees with itself (p-today-all-day, p-today-long, p-today-overnight-long) the cell says so.
- Not exercised, because they need an account and an engine: the “Synced” pill, the account name in the greeting, a notification count, and anything behind sign-in. Hover, focus, keyboard and drag states, and the real (not reduced) motion, were not exercised.
- `p-today-error`, `p-task-loading` and similar states that the build cannot reach were checked in code only.
- `p-today-goal-labels`, `p-task-date`, `p-task-move`, `p-task-subtasks` and `p-lists-empty` were not rendered (or the capture failed); their cells are from the code or from other captures, as stated in each cell.
- Whether the Planner and Account versions are v36 and v53: taken from the brief.

## Motion Designs (Planner and Account rows)

Only demos whose app title is Orbyn Planner or Orbyn Account are listed (21 of 85 demos). Generic demos (button, toggle, menu, modal, toast, sheet and others) are not listed. Durations and easings were read against `web/src/styles/tokens.css` and `tokens.ts`, not filmed. Tokens match the designs: fast 150, base 200, slow 300, page 240, exits 105 / 140 / 210 / 170, wait 400, `cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1)` and `cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1)` (`tokens.css:119-127`, `tokens.ts:6-24`, kept equal by `tokens.test.ts`).
